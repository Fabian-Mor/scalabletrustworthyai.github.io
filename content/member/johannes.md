I am currently pursuing my MSc in Machine Learning at the University of Tübingen and am a research assistant at the Scalable Trustworthy AI (STAI) group. I work on explainability, more specifically on training data attribution and concept attribution. My other interests include fairness and brain-inspired AI.

I completed my BSc in Cognitive Science at the University of Tübingen in 2023. Prior to my work at STAI, I was research assistant in the Neuro-Cognitive Modeling group at the University of Tübingen and intern at FANUC Germany.
