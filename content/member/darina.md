I am pursuing Master's degree in Machine Learning at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/), supervised by Seong Joon Oh and Arnas Uselis. 

I am interested in improving the generalization capabilities of machine learning models by better understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive their performance.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from [Nazarbayev University](https://nu.edu.kz/) in 2022.
