I am pursuing MSc degree in Data Science at the University of Tübingen, supervised by Seong Joon Oh and Elisa Nguyen. My research interests revolve around the intersection of training data attribution methods applied to large language models and fairness. Moreover, I am keen on operationalizing the EU AI Act within the industry, especially explainability and fairness requirements.  

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Political Science at Lomonosov Moscow State University and my first Master's degree in Applied Political Analysis at Higher School of Economics in Moscow.
