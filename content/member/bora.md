I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Machine Learning at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/), where I am conducting my thesis research under the supervision of Seong Joon Oh and Arnas Uselis.

My research interests lie in enhancing the generalization abilities of multimodal machine learning models and gaining deeper insight into when, why, and how they fail. I believe that studying model representations is key to understanding the underlying factors that drive model performance—both successes and failures.

Before joining the University of Tübingen, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [Middle East Technical University](https://www.metu.edu.tr/) (METU). Prior to joining the STAI group, I worked as a student assistant, contributing to the development of a [paper recommendation system](https://www.scholar-inbox.com/).
